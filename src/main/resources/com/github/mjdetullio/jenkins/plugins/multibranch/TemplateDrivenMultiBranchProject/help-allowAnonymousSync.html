    If checked, users will be allowed to anonymously trigger a branch sync via a
    POST to the URL <code>${JOB_URL}/syncBranches</code>.
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>http://www.example.com/jenkins/job/my-multi-branch-project/syncBranches</pre>
    <p>
        Otherwise, authentication is required from a user with configure
        permissions. If anonymous configuration is allowed for this job, this
        setting will have no effect.
